# basic-webgame
Husky Box is a simple game where the goal is to get the highest score possible. The user takes consecutive turns to try and enclose circles so they equal 10, and they get score equal to the number of circles enclosed. After the circles get enclosed, they dissapear, opening up new oppurtunities to enclose more circles.

## Local Storage
Local storage saves the state of the board if the user reloads the webpage or exits and comes back later. The "reset" button in the bottom left will start a new game and thus reset the local storage with the newly generated board.

## Credit
This game is heavily inspired by the online website game "Fruit Box", found at https://en.gamesaien.com/game/fruit_box/. However, all code in this project was written by me, with minor AI assistance (generating the selection box).
